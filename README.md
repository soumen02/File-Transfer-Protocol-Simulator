# File-Transfer-Protocol-Simulator
### A simple FTP implementation between a simulated server and a client that can transfer files locally.

This computer netwroks project involved building an FTP application that uses real FTP commands for communication with an FTP server. Once logged in, it allows the user to store and retrieve files from the server's directory. The port used can also be set manually. 

The program files include sample files that can be used for demonstration. 

#### How to run the program 
- Install GNU C++
- Use `make clean` and then `make` to recompile all the files.
- Run the executable created using `./filename` where filename is *Server* and *Client*
